# Research log

## Initial audit — 2026-10-02

Read the attached brief and README, experiment, next_steps, demo candidates, model/trainer/geometry and manifests. No existing AGENTS.md found in project/parent or server project. Local Git was an unborn master branch with all source files untracked; preserved original source/reports in d0d97eb on codex/multiroute-v2. Server project exists and has historical checkpoints, logs and data; it has no Git repository. No remote exists locally.

Hypothesis: fixed three-mode supervision hides ambiguity under variable reference counts and candidate budgets. First isolate this with two-wall opening-sequence data before complicating architecture. Literature and genuine observation pipeline prepare concurrently. Initial resource audit found no compute jobs; preserved historical resource limits since no higher authorization exists.

Decision: historical TEST/OOD are historical/development evidence going forward. V2 selection uses DEV_MODEL; new locked sets must stay uninspected during iteration.

## Round 1 — variable reference sets (completed)

Hypothesis: randomly selecting K references when R>K encourages an average path between incompatible passages. Compared unchanged SetRegressor with subset matching versus full positive rectangular assignment, same seed0 initialization, same scene sampling, 3000 updates, batch64, K4, 768000 gradient target slots. Both have access to the same reference pool; positive permits assignment across all R. This is a loss-objective control, not identical per-step target selection information. Code 478c4bb, 23 tests passed.

DEV_MODEL results (128 independent parents): subset UniqueValid1.77344 / Valid0.52539 / AnyValid0.75781; positive3.28906 /0.89648 /1.0. Paired UniqueValid difference1.515625, parent-bootstrap95%[1.22656,1.80469]. Durations127.52s and134.85s; controlled batch1 head median1.40ms, no VLM included. Prediction/checkpoint hashes in reports/v2_round1/artifact_index.json. Historical regressor reproduced TEST3/OOD2.90625 seed0; historical15 tests pass.

Decision: strengthen the baseline. All 53 remaining invalid positive-assignment outputs arise with R<K. When R>=4 the current probe is saturated. Do not frame known multi-modal regression loss correction as core novelty. Next actual experiment: saturation-aware positive assignment.

## Round 2 — fewer types than candidate budget (completed)

Hypothesis: random duplicate target multiplicities make excess deterministic slots regress between valid modes. Modification: minimum-cost positive assignment covering each known type once; excess slots choose any nearest known positive. Matched all other training settings. Exact assignment tested against exhaustive multisets; 24 tests pass. Code1a1b6bb; physically separated development/scoring/locked arrays (same training/development examples).

DEV_MODEL best step1500 of3000: UniqueValid3.3984375, Valid1.0, AnyValid1.0, ReferenceCoverage0.75933; this reaches mean min(K,R) for this enumerated controlled probe. Duration120.56s. No test evaluation. The last step is slightly below best (99.80% valid), retained in history. Next actual experiment: equal-parameter attention versus max coverage completion, with duplicate and verified invalid drafts, saturation-aware loss shared by both.

Recovery audit: 16 uninterrupted CPU steps versus8+resume8 produces maximum parameter difference0.0. Checkpoint preserves optimizer, scheduler, global RNG, sampler state and step. Config write moved after resume compatibility validation following independent review.
